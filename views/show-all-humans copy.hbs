  <h2>Hi,</h2>
  <p>This is my portfolio, and I hope you find something that you might like in
    here. You can find all my works under the projects sections. If you wish to
    find some interesting topics that I talk about, or would just like to stay
    up to date, you can take a look into my blog post section. I cover some
    interesting topics. Last but not least, if you'd like to leave a nice
    comment, you can fill in a guestbook entry!<br />Have fun!<br />Emmanuel</p>
